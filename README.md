# What are the sub-fields in software engineering?

It was interesting reading the other two (as of this writing) answers. They give a different perspective than what I think of regarding subfields of software engineering. So what follows is my perspective which is more focused on application domains. I suggest reading the other answers to get these other perspectives. It just goes to show that there is more than one way to slice up software engineering.

- Artificial Intelligence
- Business and Finance
- Analytics
  - Data mining
  - Decision support systems
- Banking
- Commerce
  - Trading
- Compilers, Parsers
- Communications and Networks
  - Protocols
- Computer graphics and Image Processing
- Cryptography
- Cyber-security
  - Hacking
  - Counter-measures
- Database
  - Embedded systems
  - Automotive software
  - Avionics software
  - Control Systems
  - Medical device software
  - Telephony
  - Telemetry
- Computer Aided Design (CAD)
- Games
- Information systems
- Logistics
- Manufacturing
  - Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM)
  - Distributed Control Systems (DCS)
- Music
  - Music sequencers
  - Sound effects
  - Music synthesis
- Numerical Analysis
- Office applications
  - Word processors
  - Spreadsheets
  - Presentations
- Operating systems
- Robotics
- Signal processing
- Simulation
- Testing
- Visualization
- Voting
- World wide web
  - Client-side
  - Server-side

It should be noted that many of these sub-fields overlap. It should also be noted that there is no doubt that this list is incomplete.
